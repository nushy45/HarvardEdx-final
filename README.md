#### Description: My project uses Html. I created this website because of a website that my dad and I were on and were unable to contact anyone regarding how to return it. My website is called TULUA because, in 8th grade i created a jewlery business and TULUA was the name of it. The style of my project. I was going for a modern look. I had trouble the first few times with getting my photos the right size. I chose this format for my website by looking at websites and how they were formated. 
#### Description: The conatact page is located at the end of the page andyou are able to write directly on the site. I chose this feture so that you don't have to togle between your gmail and my website. I put a gmail link on my page so that if the email box does not work you can write a email in you gmail.
#### Description: I think it is vital that I fix this issue because then my customers will not feel anxious if they are unable to get their money back. By doing this it helps our sales because our customers are more likely to return and by another iteam.
